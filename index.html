            <p> Graduating school in the mid 90's, I found myself at University, learning how to learn (science). Upon graduation I learned to surf and resisted work for as long as I could. I found my way into engineering firms and proceeded to work underwater for 8 years of my life. It was quiet, I could work, I was learning. Life was good. Eventually I became good at this so naturally i was promoted into managing projects, (aka herding cats). With enough practice I became a 'white collar factory worker' brain off, punch buttons. I needed more. As I aged I became aware that what I really enjoy was creating - things, systems, experiences, outcomes.

            I took a chance in my mid 30's left my corporate career and decided to build a machine out of humans - a gym - . A gym that appealed to middle aged people, that appealed to nerds. A gym that taught physical education progressively, that taught people how to look after themselves, that taught people how to engage in a progressive strength and flexibility practice, that taught people to enjoy being (in) a body. Now I have a child, she is 3 years old and starting to learn coding logic at kindergarten. In 10 years she will be coding to make the toys and tools that she needs to move forward, in real time. I don't want to be illiterate. Learning to code, initially with web applications in mind, allows me to continue to create, scale and leverage ideas into the future. Also, and importantly, I want to be able to help my daughter with her homework in 12 years time.
